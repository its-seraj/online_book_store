**The Online Book Store will not only help the vendors to sell their books that are in stock but also will help the customers to buy their books at ease. It can also help in the improvement of the small vendors. It provides the platform for both the small and large book vendors to sell their books at ease. This Online Book Store project requires a strong database that needs to be builded, we will discuss in detail later in this report.**

## SETUP
In this section we download and set up our Project to Local Machine. First we have to install any php server to our Local Machine (either XAMPP or WAMP for Windows). Then we have to download the project. I have uploaded this project to my GitHub Repository for ease to download. The Download link is given below : 
https://github.com/seraj48522/online_book_store/archive/main.zip

The Downloaded file is in zip format, we have to extract this into a specific folder -<br><br>
WAMP : C://wamp64/www/ 		<br><br>
XAMPP : C://xampp/htdocs/ or For Linux : /opt/lampp/htdocs/<br><br><br>


After extraction of the project, Our next step is to set up our database. <br><br>
	**step.1 :** Go to phpmyadmin page (localhost/phpmyadmin)<br><br>
**step.2 :** Create a new database with any meaningful name ( like 
    online_book_store )<br><br>
	**step.3 :** Tap on the import section given in the menu bar.<br><br>
	**step.4 :** Select your .sql file from
    /online_book_store/database/online_book_store.sql<br><br>
	**step.5 :** Tap on Go button<br><br>
  
  Congrats you have successfully set up our database. After that, put localhost/online_book_store in the url section and hit the enter button to see the Homepage of our WebApplication.
